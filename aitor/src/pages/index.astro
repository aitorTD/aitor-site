        <p>
          I started my journey in IT and software development by studying <strong
            >Web App Development</strong
          > and later specialized in <strong
            >Artificial Intelligence and Big Data</strong
          >.
          <br />
          Since then, I've been continuously improving my skills, working on projects
          that optimize workflows, enhance user experience, and leverage cloud-based
          solutions.
